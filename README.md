Espoir was a young man from South Sudan, whose family fled to the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya when he was just a child. Life in Kakuma was a test of endurance, a constant battle to survive. Espoir had once attended school back in South Sudan, but the war disrupted everything. His education, his future—everything was uncertain. In Kakuma, education was both a lifeline and a distant dream. Schools were overcrowded, and resources were scarce.

Growing up in the camp, Espoir quickly realized how challenging it was to learn in such an environment. The classrooms were makeshift, often crammed with far too many students and not enough teachers. The few textbooks available were outdated, and many students shared a single book, making learning nearly impossible. For Espoir, the greatest struggle was language. His native language was Juba Arabic, but the schools in Kakuma used English and Kiswahili. Every day felt like a new mountain to climb.

Despite these challenges, Espoir was determined to pursue his education. He dreamt of becoming an engineer, of one day rebuilding his homeland. But Kakuma was a place where dreams often died quietly, drowned out by the overwhelming challenges of daily survival. The lack of personalized support meant Espoir, like many others, struggled with gaps in his education. The teachers were overwhelmed, unable to provide the individual attention needed to help students like him.

One evening, as Espoir sat under the dim light of a makeshift lamp, he overheard a conversation that filled him with hope. His teacher was discussing a new program—a revolutionary AI tutoring system that was about to be introduced in their school. The system was designed specifically for refugee students, addressing the very challenges Espoir had faced for so long. The AI tutor would adapt to individual needs, offering lessons in multiple languages, including Juba Arabic and English. It could detect learning gaps, offering personalized support to help students catch up. Espoir couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

Soon, the AI tutoring system was implemented, and it changed everything. For the first time, Espoir had access to a learning tool that understood his needs. The lessons were tailored to his level, and he could practice both in English and Juba Arabic, building his confidence as he learned. The system was engaging, using interactive lessons and games to keep him motivated, something the overcrowded classrooms had never been able to do.

What’s more, the AI tutor could be accessed on a small tablet that Espoir could take with him. Whether he was in the camp or under the shade of a tree, he could continue learning. The progress tracking feature allowed his teacher to monitor his performance closely, giving them insights into where he needed the most help.

For the first time in years, Espoir felt like his dream was within reach. The AI tutor not only filled the gaps in his education but also gave him the confidence to keep pushing forward. He excelled in subjects that had once seemed impossible, and his love for learning was reignited. His story, however, wasn’t just his own. Many other students in Kakuma began to thrive as well, their academic performance improving dramatically. The system helped reduce the stress and frustration that had plagued so many young minds in the camp.

With time, the impact of the AI system became evident. Students in Kakuma, who had once been at the mercy of their circumstances, were now equipped with the tools to shape their own futures. For Espoir, this meant the possibility of higher education, of one day returning to South Sudan as an engineer to rebuild his war-torn country.

The system didn’t solve every problem—life in Kakuma was still hard, and the future remained uncertain—but it gave Espoir and his peers something they hadn’t had in a long time: hope. Through personalized learning, cultural sensitivity, and adaptive technology, Espoir’s education no longer felt like an impossible dream. Instead, it became his pathway out of the camp, and his story became a testament to the power of innovative solutions in the most challenging of environments

Challenge Background
Jordan hosts over 760,000 registered refugees, predominantly from Syria, with a significant portion being school-age children. Despite efforts to integrate refugee children into the education system, many face barriers such as language differences, interrupted schooling, and psychosocial challenges. The Jordanian education system is strained, with overcrowded classrooms and limited resources to address the diverse needs of refugee students.


The Problem
The core problem this project addresses is the inadequate personalized educational support for refugee students in Jordan, leading to poor academic outcomes and limited future opportunities. The key issues are:

Learning Gaps: Difficulty in addressing varied educational backgrounds and learning paces.
Language Proficiency: Challenges in providing effective instruction across different language levels.
Scalability: Limited capacity to provide individualized attention in overcrowded classrooms.
Cultural Sensitivity: Need for educational content that respects diverse cultural backgrounds.
Engagement: Difficulty in maintaining student motivation and engagement in challenging circumstances.
Progress Tracking: Lack of comprehensive systems to monitor individual student progress over time.

Goal of the Project
Develop an AI tutoring system capable of adapting to individual student needs across multiple subject areas and language levels.
Create a user-friendly interface accessible via low-cost tablets or smartphones.
Implement the system in at least 20 schools or learning centers serving refugee populations in Jordan.
Improve academic performance of participating students by at least 30% within the first year of implementation.
